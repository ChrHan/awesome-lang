Compact Kurdish - Kurmanji: Textbook with Exercises, Key and Audio-CD" is a newly released book that I plan on using as my main textbook to learn Kurmanji, atleast initially. I have yet to order it but from what I've read it seems great. It was previously only available in German, but now also in English.
erman, but now also in English.

"Kurdish Reader. Modern Literature and Oral Texts in Kurmanji: With Kurdish-English Glossaries and Grammatical Sketch" seems like a good reader for when you get to a decent level, with lots of vocabulary and grammatical explanations.

"Kurdish Phrasebook and Culture" well - It's a phrasebook.

Now we get to the BIG guns!

"Kurmanji Kurdish for Beginners". Written by professors from Harvard and Uppsala University in tandem with Kurdish intellectuals - THE book to learn Kurmanji afaik. Free to download, too. I have it printed out! :)

A great website to get you started in Kurmanji and for easily navigateable basic lessons about the language. They're constantly updating and have got a lot more lessons now than when I first got interested in Kurmanji, so this will probably by extensive in a few months/years :)

Here's one of many links to "Kurmanji Kurdish: A Reference Grammar" by W.M. Thackston, one of the best scholars of Kurdish in the west, who has also written the Sorani grammar and reader that I referenced above. It is dense, but it seems VERY good for when you're at a higher-intermediate level :)

The Critical Language Series of Arizona University also has a course, it seems good, yet not something I'd use over the above, as it is mainly/only audio, I believe.

"Learn Kurdish: A Multi-Level Course in Kurmanji"

Seems like a good basic textbook to learn most things you'd need and more. It has a bit of an outdated structure, but it has a mass of information.

Last but not least, here's just a basic introduction, but worth posting nevertheless;
