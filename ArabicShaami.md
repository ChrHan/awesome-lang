Elehay

Yonahan Elihai's books are awesome. ðŸ˜Š I also like the methods by Moin Halloun (Spoken Arabic for Foreigners) and Omar Othman (Yallah nihki arabi). In terms of online audio material I would recommend the YouTube channel LearnArabicwithMaha.

J. Elihay - "Speaking Arabic" (Palestinian-Israeli Arabic, audio alternating Jerusalem and Haifa pronunciation) [ audio + pdf samples here, I bought the 4 books, completed the first one actively, and currently listening and reading the 2nd one ]

* the "DLIFLC" - field support languages phrasebooks - english-arabic - http://fieldsupport.dliflc.edu - I'm listening to the Palestinian, Jordanian and Syrian, Basic and Medical guides when available (my jogging tracks for now)
* Madrasa :: https://www.madrasafree.net - currently Hebrew based (but they're planning German and English source as well soon I think) , 
you can listen to the dialogs here: - they use a Hebrew-Alphabet transliteration (which is 1-1) - I wrote a script that transcribes this to Arabic-font if you want
