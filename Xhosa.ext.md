Have you tried materials from Xhosa Fundis?  Visit www.xhosafundis.co.za  Also from ubuntu bridge, visit www.learnxhosa.co.za



Also the nal’ibali website  - I think they have stories recorded in Xhosa - http://nalibali.org/



>>anyhow - I've just found your video lecture, I'll watch it, I'm quite interested in learning Xhosa to an intermediate level so far, and in helping increasing the online availability of related language resources , if you can recommend any media (tv shows , radio podcasts etc) I'm also interested

That’s great news that you are so committed to learning Xhosa.  I always listen to uMhlobo wenene http://www.umhlobowenenefm.co.za/digital/player/1.0/umhlobowenenefm/index.html



If you type XHOSA into Youtube you will get quite a few movies/series etc. Here are a few:
